Compiler Design (Spring 2019)

I took this course last spring. Overall the course involved building a compiler low-level to high-level basically. 
This repo has some project files from that course. We learnt a lot about lexing and parsing between different
languages like Tiger, LLVM, HERA using Haskell.
